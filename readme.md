To run a Flask app, you need to follow these steps:

Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your Flask app is located.

Once you are in the correct directory, activate your virtual environment if you are using one.

Set the Flask application environment variable by running:

On Windows: set FLASK_APP=<your_app_name>.py
On Mac/Linux: export FLASK_APP=<your_app_name>.py
Replace <your_app_name> with the name of the main Python file that runs your Flask app (without the .py extension).

Optionally set the Flask environment (e.g., production, development, etc.) by running the following command:

On Windows: set FLASK_ENV=<environment>
On Mac/Linux: export FLASK_ENV=<environment>
Replace <environment> with the name of the environment you want to set (production, development, etc.). If you don't set this variable, Flask will default to the production environment.

Finally, run the Flask app by typing the following command into the terminal or command prompt:

Diff
Copy
Insert
New
flask run
This command starts the Flask development server and listens for incoming requests.

Once the server is up and running, open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 (or whichever port number you chose to use). You should see your Flask app running in the browser.

That's it â€“ you've successfully run your Flask app!'
